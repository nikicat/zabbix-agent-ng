zabbix-agent-ng
Nikolay Bryskin <devel.niks@gmail.com>

It's an improved Zabbix agent.
Main features:
  * Virtual hosts support (based on settings from LDAP)
  * Using gevent for input-output (very high speed of items
    checking/sending, up to 1000 items per second)
  * Extensible not only with shell script, but also Python modules
  * Support of simultaneous item checking (usefull for dependend items,
    for example, CPU utilization times)
  * Zabbix 1.4 and 1.8 protocols support
  * Upstart support

TODO:
  * Other methods to load virtual hosts list (text file, database, etc.)
  * Separate check intervals for items with same script
